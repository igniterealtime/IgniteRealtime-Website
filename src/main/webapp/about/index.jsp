                    <p>
                        Igniterealtime is an Open Source community composed of end-users, developers and service providers
                        around the world who are interested in applying innovative, open-standards-based Real Time
                        Collaboration to their businesses. We're aimed at disrupting proprietary, non-open
                        standards-based systems and invite you to participate in what's already one of the biggest
                        and most active Open Source communities anywhere.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="larger">Open Source Philosophy</h2>

                    <p>
                        We create Open Source software because we know open, collaborative minds can improve the
                        software landscape. We believe in the potential of the XMPP protocol and we welcome ways
                        to increase its adoption. We put tremendous value on the involvement of Igniterealtime's
                        developer and user community--their continuous feedback, QA, and development efforts
                        help steer our development path.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We are committed to live out the values of the Open Source movement to the best of our
                        abilities, to act responsibly and in the best interests of our community and to be highly
                        responsive to the needs of the community and communicate proactively.

                    <h2 class="larger">The XMPP Protocol</h2>


                    <p>
            XMPP (also known as Jabber) is the leading open standard for presence and
                        real-time messaging. Since 2004, it's been an approved standard of the IETF
                        (the same organization that standardized email and World Wide Web protocols).
                        A rich set of <a href="http://www.xmpp.org/extensions/">extensions</a> to
                        the protocol are maintained by the <a href="http://www.jabber.org">Jabber Software Foundation</a>.
                        Today, XMPP is used by leading companies, millions of users worldwide and
                        is the best choice for open real-time collaboration.

                    <p>
                        Open standards are critical in order to achieve a completely federated
                        environment where real time collaboration software works seamlessly
                        together. This will drive the medium forward as a unified productivity tool
                        and provide the greatest benefit to end users. The hundreds of interoperable
                        software products that use XMPP prove the reality of this vision.

                        Ignite Realtime furthers XMPP through best of breed protocol implementations,
                        development of new protocol extensions, and participation to the XMPP Standards Foundation (XSF).
